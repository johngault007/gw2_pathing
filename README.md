# Guild Wars 2 Pathing Project

This repository was created as a means to learn more about marker packs and pathing in Guild Wars 2. The curiosity started as a means to 
create ad-hoc paths and marker packs that weren't available in the larger repos such as Tekkit's and Lady Elyysa's. 

My first project involves a streamlined Obscure Chest run in the new maps of Castora in the Visions of Eternity expansion pack. There were no adequate marker packs available, as the chest run was mentioned as a forum post on the Guild Wars 2 forum. 

### Where Can I Use This

Currently the marker pack is developed in GW Tactical Overaly (TacO) and can be loaded in a local instance. While I have no intention to develop a full scale repository that would be available through BlishHud, I can't rule it out entirely.

I am currently using icons from [Lady Elyssa's](https://github.com/LadyElyssa) marker packs. This was an intentional decision as I am not publishing these
packs anywhere, and my original intention was to learn how to create marker packs with the goal of contributing to a larger repository such as Elyssa's.

### How Do I Use This

This section is under maintenance and I highly doubt I will contribute to troubleshooting the installation and use of marker packs. So I have included some resources you can use to help you install and use marker packs.
