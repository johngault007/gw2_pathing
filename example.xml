	This is where the organization for your pack happens, and where you can assign attributes on a categorical level
	If you're looking for information on attributes, the best place to start is: https://blishhud.com/docs/markers/development/attributes/


	This is your main category, e.g. your entire pack goes inside of this 
	 |    All marker categories have at least two attributes 
	 |         The 'name' attribute is how the category is referenced internally (in the 'type' attribute of a marker)
     |               | The 'displayName' attribute is what will be shown to the user when looking through categories
	 |               |            | 
     V               V            V -->
	<MarkerCategory name="" displayName="">
	
		<!-- This is an example of a sub-category -->
		<MarkerCategory name="" displayName="">
		
			<!-- This is an example of an actual marker
			      |    Markers have an additional 'iconFile' attribute, which is the path to what image will be used for that marker
			      |                                  |               Markers are closed with a '/' because they do not contain other markers
			      |                                  |                              |   
			      V                                  V                              V   -->

			<!-- This is an example of a trail category
				  |                                  Trails use the texture attribute instead of iconFile
				  |                                                    |     Trails also require fadeNear and fadeFar, which are when the trail starts to fade and completely disappears, respectively

INCLUDE WAYPOINTS THAT COPY TO CLIPBOARD

<POI copy="[&amp;BEEBAAA=]" copy-message="Wychmire Waypoint"/>

copy="string" - String will be copied to clipboard when the marker is triggered. Usually used with autotrigger enabled.
copy-message="string" - String will be displayed in the middle of the screen when the clipboard copy is triggered. 

autoTrigger="boolean" - Determines if going near the marker triggers it.

#### BEHAVIOR - number for custom behavior (what happens when you press F over a marker)
<POI behavior="X"

0 - Default non-interactive marker, always visible
1 - Reappear when you change maps
2 - Reappear on daily reset
3 - Disappear forever once you press F
4 - Reappear after a time determined by variable resetLength
    - resetLength - how long the marker should be invisible after pressing "F"
5 - Reappear on map reset
    - resetLength - how long a map cycle is
6 - Reappear after you change map or instance of the same map
7 - Reappear once per daily per character

#### Distance
fadeNear - Determines how far the marker will start to fade out.
fadeFar - Determines how far the marker will completely disappear.

#### Info
<POI info="string"> - Multiline string that will show up on screen as text when the player is inside of infoRange
  - infoRange="float" - Determines how far away from the marker th info string will be visible
